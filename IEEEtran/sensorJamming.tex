% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
The autonomous vehicle or the 'self-driving car', once thought to be a distant technology of the future, is fast becoming a soon to be reality as a form of transportation. The technology promises to make driving safer, lessen traffic in busy cities and to improve upon the general driving experience, to name just a few of the benefits. \\
\indent One of the crucial aspects that make autonomous vehicles a possibility is sensor technology. Sensors allow a vehicle to become aware or "see" their surroundings. Sensor technology necessary for autonomous driving will likely vary from manufacturer to manufacturer but would probably include ultrasonic, radar, LIDAR, GPS, camera sensors and light sensors at the very least. These sensor types are not only limited to self-driving cars, this technology is used in many other areas such as unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) or drones, use a lot of similar technology in order to sense its surroundings and location. \\
\indent Autonomous vehicles must not only keep the passengers of the car safe but also not cause harm to any other cars, pedestrians or anything a vehicle could come into contact with. Due to this fact, there is a heavy burden placed upon this technology to function without fail. This means that sensor technology within the vehicle cannot be defective and this includes not being susceptible to malicious attacks or accidental attacks. One of the biggest threats sensors face in autonomous vehicles is \textit{sensor jamming}. \\
\indent It is necessary to first have a clear idea of what sensor jamming is. Sensor jamming is typically defined as any outside party or entity that is intentionally sending or causing interference to signals being sent or received to sensors during autonomous sensor communication\cite{2}\cite{7}. Although there are different types of jamming attacks that are possible, they will likely fall under this broad definition \cite{7}. Jamming is typically done with a device that will send signals flood the sensor with false data that misrepresents the surroundings or overwhelms the sensor causing it to fail. Additionally, jamming can be done through blocking the signals to and from the sensor. Various types of sensor jamming will be discussed in a later section.\\

\subsection{Mission Statement}
For this paper, our initial research goals were to determine possible sensor jamming \textit{detection} and \textit{mitigation} techniques for sensors within autonomous vehicles. Stopping or mitigating the effects of sensor jamming is crucial for functionality, safety, and widespread adoption of autonomous technology. Throughout our research, we wanted to also put into practice and perform testing and analysis of techniques ourselves in addition to analyzing other researched sensor jamming detection and mitigation techniques. \\

\subsection{Context of Research Area}
The focus and context in which we performed our research was on sensors and their usage within autonomous vehicles. Although many of the jamming detection and mitigation techniques are applicable to many types of sensors, we focused upon ultrasonic sensors, especially in our own testing and analysis.\\ \indent There are a few reasons for this, the first being that autonomous vehicles use ultrasonic sensors for close range detection of objects to assist with parking, adaptive cruise control and traffic jam assist\cite{10}. These are very important features to for safety in autonomous vehicles, as well newer non-autonomous vehicles that include some variation of these features, and if these are sensors are jammed, functionality is severely impacted. Failure can cause danger to passengers and vehicle surroundings. A second reason ultrasonic sensors had more focus was due to the relative low price and availability of these sensors to use for testing. In this paper, we will discuss further how an ultrasonic transducer(HC-SR04) used with an Arduino Uno was used during testing to gather data and provide a proof of concept to our hypothesis that jamming attacks that cause objects around a vehicle to be hidden from ultrasonic sensors can be done with cheap and readily available equipment.\\
\indent In addition to the testing that was done, several types of jamming detection and mitigation techniques were researched and analyzed. Detection and mitigation techniques studied were \textit{frequency hopping}\cite{2}\cite{4}, \textit{signal verification protocols}\cite{6}\cite{7}, and the \textit{filtering/extraction of jamming signals}\cite{4}\cite{5}.\\
\subsection{Terminology}
This section defines commonly used terminology throughout the paper.\\

\section{Sensor Jamming Attack Models}
There are various ways in which a sensor can be jammed. Because of this jamming attacks can be split up into subcategories. This section includes some of the most common types jamming came across throughout the research process.\\
\begin{description}

  \item[$\bullet$ Constant Jamming:] A constant jamming attack is one that operates by emitting a constant stream of random interfering signals the target sensor. This type of attack typically doesn't wait for any communication from the sensor, the attack is consistent and constant while it is happening. This type of attack can block any legitimate signal traffic from communicating with the sensor\cite{5}.\\
   \item[$\bullet$ Deceptive Jamming:] A jamming device tricks the sensor by sending packets or signals to the sensor. The sensor believes this to be a real packet and will switch into a receiving state. By continuously sending these normal signals to the sensor, the sensor is unable to send signals because it is falsely stuck in a receive state\cite{5}.\\
    \item[$\bullet$ Random Jamming:]  A random jamming attack will oscillate between states of sleeping and awake. When a random jamming device is awake, it can operate as a constant jammer or a deceptive jammer. This is done to conserve energy and not have the jamming device powered on at all times\cite{5}. \\
     \item[$\bullet$ Reactive Jamming:] The three previous jamming attacks typically target the entire frequency or channel the sensor is operating on. A reactive jamming attack is different in that it will remain idle while listening and scanning traffic until there is activity on the operating frequency band and the jammer will then be able to match and attack that sensor's signals\cite{2}\cite{5}.\\

\end{description}

\section{Related/Previous Works}
There have been numerous studies on sensory jamming within autonomous technology. Three of the top studies include, frequency/channel hopping, signal verification algorithms, and filtering of the jamming signals. Each is discussed further below.\\

\textit{Signal Verification Protocol and Algorithms} is a key way to detect anomalies within the sensors. To find these anomalies the signal to noise ratio(SNR) can be used. A deviation in normal SNR will cause sensors to malfunction. Kar et al.\cite{6} implement a low cost jammer identification device that can detect jammers. Using smartphones, interfering signals can were detected and were able to track the movement of the jammer using roadside cameras. This method can help track and stop the incoming jamming signals. This research also strategically placed GPS locators along the highway to track and locate the jamming devices\cite{6}. The ability to track down the jamming signals can help identify and stop the adversary.\\ 
\textit{Frequency Hopping} is used in wireless communication that allows radio signals to constantly switch the operating frequency channels. Frequency hopping(FH) can aid in mitigating jamming by evading the attacker and preventing them from knowing which frequency channel a sensor is operating on. FH can make it much more difficult for the attacker to know the frequency band to attack\cite{1}\cite{3}\cite{2}. Research shows that that a short duration time between channels can help reduce the impact on inference\cite{1}. This is important to our study because wireless technology will be needed in autonomous vehicles. Being able to avoid or mitigate the effects of jamming devices, will greatly improve the well being of anyone who used autonomous vehicles. Making sure autonomous vehicles are able to freely communicate without flaw is crucial.\\ 
\textit{Filtering of the Jamming Signals} Filtering and extraction techniques can be used to reduce the effects of sensor jamming\cite{5}.  Jamming signals can be filtered or extracted out with either a low-pass filter or an excision filter.  An excision filter removes a signal if its bandwidth is smaller then the signal bandwidth and a low-pass filter removes jamming signals wider than the sensor's signals bandwidth\cite{5}. These methods of mitigating jamming attacks are typically used in conjunction with other techniques such as frequency hopping\cite{5}.\\

\section{Problem Overview} Since the beginning years of technology, cyber security experts and hackers have been fighting to gain control. When it comes to autonomous vehicle technology, safety and security are a serious concern. If hackers were to gain control of an autonomous vehicle, passenger and pedestrian safety will be greatly at risk. It is essential for autonomous technology to be attack resistant in order to create a safe mode of transportation and to establish consumer confidence. This paper focuses on autonomous vehicle sensors and their susceptibility to jamming. Jammers are capable of fooling or completely blocking the signals needed for the sensor to work properly. This is particularly dangerous when it comes to autonomous vehicles because a car can be rendered invisible to other cars. Since sensor jamming can cause dangerous conditions it is crucial to mitigate the effects of jamming.\\

\subsection{Problem Statement}
With the rise of autonomous technology sensors play a crucial role in the proper functioning of the technology. Sensors are susceptible to jamming causing potential danger to the passengers(s) or any surroundings. Sensors must function effectively while also actively preventing malicious attacks at all times in order to mitigate and avoid the dangers of jamming.\\
\subsection{Challenges of the Problem}
Detecting sensor jamming is not trivial and has many fallbacks.  Sensor jamming is a serious threat that can affect all sensors. Detecting an ongoing attack as soon as possible will mitigate the dangerous of jamming.  There are many different methods to help mitigate the effects of sensor jamming but what are the best method(s)?  Do we use a combined approach? Using signal verification alone has many drawbacks.  Jamming detection is easily susceptible to false positives and the algorithms used are not enough to detect all types of jamming\cite{6}\cite{7}.  Filtering and extracting signals has it?s own downfalls. A jammer can easily observe the signals bandwidth so it can bypass an excision and low-pass filters. Filtering and extracting signals is best used alongside frequency hoping\cite{4}\cite{5}. Frequency hopping is not yet sophisticated enough to thoroughly prevent jamming. Frequency hopping can easily be worked around if enough jammers are set up. Switching between frequencies can reduce the devices performance [5][6][8]. The previously mentioned techniques when used alone may not be enough to stop a jamming attack but when used together a jamming attack can be tracked and mitigated much more reliably. \\

Description of different types of jamming detection and prevention from research. How we were able to simulate or evaluate it's effectiveness.
\subsection{Group Experimentation and Testing}
\subsubsection{Computer Experiment}

We needed to find out that we could create measurable interference with the tools that we had. Considering that ultrasonic sensors in vehicles are not very different from sensors that could be purchased for testing platforms such as Arduino, we decided to make a small experiment for proof that it would work. If successful in this attempt, knowledge gained for subsequent testing could prove useful.

\subsubsection{Setup}

To test our setup, we purchased two Arduino Uno boards, two breadboards, a set of cables, and two HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensors. The first step was to create a small program to run on the Arduino that gave an output in inches, so that we could stream our output in readable data. This program to run the sensor and convert the output was uploaded onto both Arduino boards and set to loop indefinitely. Test one was simply to ensure the sensor was accurate and that the program ran as intended. One of the HC-SR04 units, connected to an Arduino was placed 13 inches from a box large enough to be hit by the ultrasonic sound waves and bounce back to the unit. This Uno unit was also connected to a computer, which displayed its output of inches live by running a very simple python program that logged the results in the python console as they were made available.  \\
Next, we wanted to ensure that we could be \textit{jammed}. To do this, we kept the same setup as the previous test, but introduced the second Arduino and HC-SR04 where the box was, aiming the output of the sensor towards the sensor connected to the computer. 

\subsubsection{Results}

For the first test, we were able to prove the correctness of our program and the accuracy of the sensor unit. The accuracy was determined to be $\pm 0.04$ inches. Example outputs from the python console were: $12.96, 12.96, 13.00, 13.01$ \\
Following the confirmation above, we setup the second test as described. The results were as expected. Since ultrasonic sensors work by pulsing a wave, bouncing it off the object and receiving it back - all while counting the time that it takes to do so, we expected the output to be halved. This is because the matching unit placed across from the one connected to the computer was emitting the same frequency at the same time. So while the wave from the unit logging was being sent, an opposing wave was also being sent. When received by the unit logging the distance, it was indiscriminately halving the distance because the signal was being received sooner than expected. Example outputs from the python console were: $6.48, 6.31, 6.49$
\subsubsection{Proof of Concept}

Now that we understood that simply pointing a sensor on or near the same frequency as the one being relied upon at it could considerably reduce the accuracy, we wanted to see if it would work on a vehicle.

\subsubsection{Setup}

We used the first vehicle available to us with ultrasonic sensors. It was a 2016 GMC Sierra that had an array of 4 ultrasonic sensors placed in its rear bumper as part of the backup collision warning system. Our goal was to see if we could manipulate the sensor into either seeing something that didn't exist or to hide something that was actually in the path of the vehicle. We used the same sensor as in test one in the previous section and placed it on a large metal folding chair behind the vehicle, roughly 4 feet from the leftmost rear sensor in the bumper. We raised our jamming sensor even more with cardboard to make it level with the sensor on the vehicle. With the jamming sensor turned off, we turned on the vehicle and placed it in reverse. Immediately the collision warning system produced an alert, and properly identified the chair behind the vehicle. We then turned on our jamming sensor and tried moving it around behind the vehicle, to see if any one position worked better than others.

\subsubsection{Results}

After a few attempts, we were able to hide the chair from the collision avoidance system. With the jamming sensor behind the vehicle 4ft and to the left of the rear bumper turned towards it by $10^{\circ}$, the system never alerted us of the chair's presence. Further backing up during that attempt allowed us to almost drive into the chair with no warning. \\
As it did take a few tries to get right, this was proof enough for us to look into ways to prevent such jamming, even if it happened on occasion. A realistic situation may even be two cars equipped with ultrasonic backup sensors backing up towards each other in a crowded parking lot. It was time to study ways of preventing this.
\subsection{Frequency Hopping}
\indent FH can also help prevent jamming that happens when there is 'cross-talk' between sensors. This occurs when sensors of the same type, operating on the same frequency are close enough that they are sending signals to or receiving signals from the nearby sensors accidentally\cite{3}. This causes sensors to receive false data or accidentally jam other sensors. If these near-by sensors have signals FH enough it is unlikely they would interfere with each other. Meng. et. al. proposes a strategy to mitigate this type of jamming by transmitting ultrasonic signals in pseudo-random pulses within varying frequencies. The sensor then waits on an expected, returned signal corresponding to the pseudo-random pulse and frequency that was sent out\cite{3}.
\subsection{Signal Verification Protocols and Algorithms}
Verification protocols and algorithms can be implemented on different types of sensors in order to detect and identify if a jamming attack is taking place. Once detected, action can be taken to evade the attack. Measurements are taken on signal communication as part of these protocols or algorithms in order to detect any irregularities in signal traffic. Different protocols or algorithms will take into account different metrics or variables involved in signal communication in order to determine irregular behavior\cite{7}. Much of the difficulty in detecting jamming is due to sensors being unable to differentiate between legitimate signal traffic and attacker interference.[w.XU]. This section will discuss several different types of jamming detection methods utilizing verification protocols or algorithms. 

\subsubsection{Signal to Noise Ratio}
A widely used metric for sensors monitoring data is the \textit{signal to noise ratio}(SNR). This measures the expected signal strength level in relation to a normal baseline of background noise for signal communication traffic. In other words, SNR will show signal power to noise power. Noise can be considered any signal traffic being picked up by the sensor that is not the desired send or receive signal of the sensor. \\
\indent A sensor can use SNR in order to detect jamming traffic. Sensors will likely have a range of SNR that is normal and used as a baseline when monitor signal traffic. If there is a deviation away from the expected range of SNR, this could indicate to the sensor that there is a jamming attack taking place. A deviation could mean there is a higher than normal amount of real signal traffic, which could be a jammer sending 'legitimate' signals, like in a deceptive jamming attack. Alternatively, a deviation away from the expected SNR could be due to a jamming attack that is appearing as 'noise' to the sensor. In either case, there will be a deviation away from the expected SNR and this will be viewed as a signal traffic anomaly to the sensor \cite{6}. 
%picture%
\indent Kar et. al. discusses how SNR can be used to detect anomalies in signal traffic that could indicate a jamming attack is taking place\cite{6}. This research focuses on GPS technology but the concept is applicable to many different sensor types. This work discusses the difficulty in differentiating SNR deviations from \textit{signal fading}. Fading occurs when there is a variation in the intensity, or attenuation of a signal due to variables like location or radio frequency. This research demonstrates that SNR or \textit{signal-to-interference-plus-noise density ratio}(SINR) will decrease if there is an increase interference or signal fading occurs\cite{6}. In order to get around impacting the SNR or SINR and alerting the sensor to a potential attack, the goal of a jammer, among other aspects, should be to reduce any interference or noise caused during an attack so as not to be detected\cite{13}. 
%picture%
\subsubsection{Packet Send and Delivery Ratio}
A sensor can use \textit{packet send ratio}(PSR) and \textit{packet delivery ratio}(PDR) as a means of detecting a jamming attack\cite{12}. An attacker can attempt to jam a sensor by preventing it from sending signals as well as corrupting or destroying signals in transmission\cite{12}\cite{7}. Measuring PSR and PDR is a useful metric to detect jamming during these types of attacks. From the sender point of view, the number of packets sent during a specified amount of time will determine the PSR. The PDR can be calculated by the sensor based on the number of signals sent and the number of response signals it receives back. For both PSR and PDR, a baseline will be established during a set time frame to determine normal ratio ranges. \\
\indent A lower PSR will be a good indicator of a jammer blocking a sensor from sending signals. An decrease in PDR can be an indication of signals being corrupted during transmission. Alternatively, an increase in PDR can indicate that there are interfering signals being sent to the sensor. PSR and PDR essentially let a sensor know if signals are being sent and received at the rate they should be were a jammer not present\cite{12}\cite{7}. Combined with PDR signal strength consistency checks can be used\cite{7}. High signal strength measurements should correspond to high PDR. However, if there were a high signal strength measurement and low PDR or vice versa, this could indicate that interference is taking place\cite{7}.
\subsubsection{Measuring Signal Strength}
A method to detect jamming that is often employed by sensors is measuring signal strength\cite{12}. By gathering enough data on normal signal strength measurements, a sensor can create a statistical model of normal signal levels and traffic\cite{7}. Previous studies measure signal strength by measuring the average signal magnitude on a sensor's operating frequency spectrum as well as calculating signal threshold from ambient noise levels, which is somewhat similar to the concept behind SNR measurements, and determining the shape of a normal signal spectrum\cite{12}\cite{7}. These methodologies run into difficulties making determinations between a harmless increase in signal traffic and an actual jamming attack. 
\subsection{Filtering and Extraction Techniques}
Filtering the bandwidth a sensor is operating on can potentially filter or extract out interfering signals from jamming attacks. In \cite{5} different types of filters are used in the sensor's frequency bandwidth that attempt to remove jamming signals.
An \textit{excision filter} can be employed on the signal bandwidth that suppresses interfering signals smaller than the signal's bandwidth. The excision filter is smaller than the sensor's bandwidth and it attempts to filter out narrowband interference. The filter essentially removes the signal power of the jammer\cite{5}. %photo%
A \textit{low-pass filter} can be implemented to combat a jamming signal that is wider than the sensor's operating signal frequency spectrum. This removes any power to jamming signals that are outside of the operating frequency of the sensor. However, the resulting jamming signal is now the same bandwidth as the sensor's bandwidth. 
%photo%
While both of these filter types can contribute to lessening the power of a jammer, when used alone they do not do much to mitigate the impact of a jamming device. In \cite{5} the use of these filters also requires that the signal frequency is constantly hopping when in use, in order to evade the jammer.

% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,

% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the

% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words

% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
